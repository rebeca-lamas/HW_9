# Employee Database SQL Challenge
This challenge examines several CSVs of employee information to be converted into a database.
## Data Modeling
Created an ERD to sketch out the relationship between the tables.
## Data Engineering
Used the ERD to create table schemas for each of the CSVs. The schemas included data types, primary keys, foreign keys and other constraints. The CSVs were then loaded into SQL.
## Data Analysis
Now the database has be created, the data was analyzed through a series of queries.
